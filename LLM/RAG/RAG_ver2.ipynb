Introduction \\n \\nRecently, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology, which \\ninvolves the underground storage of carbon dioxide (CO 2), has gained \\nsignificant attention to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Domestic \\nresearch on underground CO 2 storage has been actively carried out, \\nfocusing on exploring suitable sites on land and in the ocean since \\n2010. Through the Pohang Offshore Small-Scale CO 2 Storage \\nDemonstration Project initiated in 2013, South Korea successfully \\nconducted the first domestic CO 2 injection test in 2017. However, due \\nto societal concerns about the potential for earthquakes, domestic \\nCCS projects were put on hold for a while. Although discussions about \\nCCS projects in the open sea, which pose lower seismic risks due to \\nthe cessation of gas production which is depleted in the East Sea gas \\nfield, have regained momentum, domestic carbon dioxide monitoring \\ntechnology is still lacking. The purpose of this study is to establish a \\nfoundation for international collaborative research with Norway, a \\ncountry with advanced monitoring capabilities for subsurface stored \\nCO2 (as part of the 2022 South Korea-North Europe cooperation \\nproject). This study aims to secure a 4D anisotropic seismic \\nmonitoring algorithm based on Reverse Time Migration as basic \\nresearch for international cooperation research (2022 Korea-Nordic', metadata={'source': '/home/user/다운로드/test2.pdf', 'page': 10}), Document(page_content='- 2 -   \\n cooperation project) with Norway, which has excellent monitoring \\ncapabilities for CO 2 stored underground.  \\n The 4D elastic wave monitoring technique involves performing \\n3D elastic wave imaging from the collected monitoring data obtained \\nthrough repetitive 3D explorations. This technique estimates changes \\nin reflectivity based on variations in the properties of the storage \\nreservoir (Lumley, 2010). The 4D elastic wave monitoring \\ntechnology, which has been validated through the Norwegian Sleipner \\nProject, has garnered recent attention as a method to monitor the \\nbehavior of injected CO 2 after injection in subsurface CO 2 storage \\nprojects (Chadwick et al., 2004; Arts et al., 2008). \\n The core of the 4D elastic wave monitoring technique involves \\nrepeatedly imaging 3D elastic wave exploration data to estimate \\nsubsurface changes through variations in the exploration data. \\nChoosing a migration method that can image a substantial amount of \\n3D elastic wave exploration data is important to enhance the signal-\\nto-noise ratio and achieve accurate spatial imaging. In 4D elastic \\nwave monitoring, accurately estimating the spatial distribution of \\ninjected CO 2 through changes in weak signals requires combining as \\nmuch data as possible to improve the signal-to-noise ratio while \\nachieving precise spatial imaging through migration methods. \\nConsidering factors like computational complexity, accuracy, and \\npotential improvement in signal-to-noise ratio due to 3D migration,', metadata={'source': '/home/user/다운로드/test2.pdf', 'page': 11}), Document(page_content='- 3 -   \\n Kirchhoff migration (Buske, 1999) and Reverse-Time Migration \\n(RTM) based on numerical analysis modeling (Baysal et al., 1983) \\nappear to be the most promising. While Kirchhoff migration is \\npreferred for its computational efficiency and image resolution in \\nlarge-scale 3D imaging processes, RTM based on numerical analysis \\nmodeling is more suitable for its repeatability and accuracy in imaging, \\ndespite its longer computational time due to solving the wave equation \\nin both directions. RTM is advantageous for understanding complex \\ngeological structures as it accounts for all reflection paths.  \\nWith the advancement of high-performance computing technology, \\n3D RTM is gradually replacing Kirchhoff migration (Chang and \\nMcMechan, 1989; Yoon et al., 2003; Dussaud et al., 2008), and \\nvarious techniques are being actively developed to enhance the \\nperformance of RTM (Perrone et al., 2011; Crawley et al., 2012; Oh \\net al., 2021).

In isotropic imaging assumptions, \\ndistant offset data must be excluded. However, in cases of low signal-\\nto-noise ratio exploration data, using as much data as possible can \\nimprove the signal-to-noise ratio during the stacking process. \\nAdditionally, during 4D time-lapse monitoring, due to the small \\namplitude changes in reflection waves caused by injected carbon \\ndioxide, amplification of these changes requires using more data. \\nTherefore, for time-lapse monitoring in regions with strong \\nanisotropy, it's desirable to use imaging techniques that account for \\nanisotropy and utilize all offset data. \\nTime-lapse monitoring algorithms based on RTM can be \\nimplemented by replacing conventional isotropic wave equations with \\nanisotropic wave equations.

Elastic Wave Anisotropy \\n \\nAnisotropy refers to the variation in material properties based on \\ndirection. Anisotropy in a medium can lead to elastic wave anisotropy, \\nwhere wave velocities differ depending on the direction of propagation \\nduring the wave's propagation process. Traditional elastic wave \\nsurveys have primarily focused on subsurface reflections within the \\nsubcritical reflection angle range. However, recently, to enhance \\nimaging quality and improve the applicability of inversion, receivers \\nhave been deployed to acquire data from the supercritical reflection \\nangle range, including data from distant offsets. In the subcritical \\nreflection regime, the angle of incidence is small, favoring \\npredominantly vertical components of wave propagation. In contrast, \\nrefracted and supercritical reflected waves exhibit relatively larger \\nhorizontal components. In regions where elastic wave anisotropy is \\npresent, the velocities in the vertical and horizontal directions differ. \\nConsequently, in regions with strong anisotropy, attempting to \\naccurately correct both subcritical and supercritical reflections with a \\nsingle P-wave velocity assumption, as would be done under isotropic \\nassumptions, becomes challenging. Therefore, if elastic wave survey \\ndata for exploration of oil and gas or monitoring of subsurface carbon \\ndioxide storage are acquired in regions with strong anisotropy,\", metadata={'source': '/home/user/다운로드/test2.pdf', 'page': 25}), Document(page_content='- 17 -   \\n imaging algorithms that appropriately account for anisotropy should \\nbe applied. \\nThere are three major causes of anisotropy in depositional basins \\nthat are targeted for oil and gas exploration or subsurface carbon \\ndioxide storage (Oh, 2020). The first cause is intrinsic anisotropy \\nfound in rocks (or the minerals composing them), such as shale. The \\nsecond cause is apparent anisotropy that arises in depositional basins \\nwhere thin layers interact. This apparent anisotropy occurs when the \\nvertical layering structure changes, which is much smaller compared \\nto the wavelength of elastic waves (Backus, 1962). The third cause \\nis induced anisotropy resulting from the presence of vertically \\noriented fracture zones within the depositional basin. The most \\ncommon anisotropies observed in depositional basins are Horizontal \\nTransverse Isotropy (HTI) and Vertical Transverse Isotropy (VTI). \\nAmong the three causes mentioned earlier, the first and second \\ncauses commonly lead to HTI anisotropy, while the third cause can \\ninduce VTI anisotropy. \\nProceeding with modeling without considering anisotropy can lead \\nto distortions in the model, loss of positional accuracy, reduced \\nresolution, decreased signal-to-noise ratio, and phenomena like the \\nHockey Stick effects.

Conclusions \\n \\nIn this study, we proposed a 4D elastic wave monitoring algorithm \\nconsidering anisotropic media. When strong anisotropy exists below \\nthe upper layer of the subsurface and carbon dioxide is injected, \\ntraditional isotropic monitoring algorithms show varying depths of \\nestimated reflection points due to anisotropy based on offsets. This \\nleads to distortion of in-depth information of injected carbon dioxide \\nand reduced resolution of the injection layer's reflection points. The \\nanisotropic monitoring algorithm based on elliptically separable \\nanisotropic acoustic wave equations could estimate consistent depth \\ninformation from all offset data, enabling effective superposition of \\nreflection points at the injection layer. As a result, it provided more \\naccurate depth information and sharper images. Furthermore, the \\nmonitoring algorithm assuming elliptical anisotropy was found to \\napproximate anisotropy with a computational cost nearly equivalent \\nto isotropic monitoring. To apply this to real monitoring data, a multi-\\nvariable inversion technique for estimating subsurface anisotropic \\ninformation must be used in conjunction.\", metadata={'source': '/home/user/다운로드/test2.pdf', 'page': 59}), Document(page_content=\"- 51 -   \\n References \\n \\n1.

      "관련 정보: page_content=' - 3 -   \\n Kirchhoff migration (Buske, 1999) and Reverse-Time Migration \\n(RTM) based on numerical analysis modeling (Baysal et al., 1983) \\nappear to be the most promising. While Kirchhoff migration is \\npreferred for its computational efficiency and image resolution in \\nlarge-scale 3D imaging processes, RTM based on numerical analysis \\nmodeling is more suitable for its repeatability and accuracy in imaging, \\ndespite its longer computational time due to solving the wave equation \\nin both directions. RTM is advantageous for understanding complex \\ngeological structures as it accounts for all reflection paths.  \\nWith the advancement of high-performance computing technology, \\n3D RTM is gradually replacing Kirchhoff migration (Chang and \\nMcMechan, 1989; Yoon et al., 2003; Dussaud et al., 2008), and \\nvarious techniques are being actively developed to enhance the \\nperformance of RTM (Perrone et al., 2011; Crawley et al., 2012; Oh \\net al., 2021). RTM computes wavefield operators for repeated use, \\nmaking it suitable for time-lapse elastic wave monitoring that \\nrequires repeated accurate subsurface imaging. Therefore, \\nconsidering the potential for further development, ongoing research \\ninto 4D elastic wave monitoring technology based on RTM remains \\nnecessary. \\nThe quality of Reverse-Time Migration (RTM) results is heavily \\ninfluenced by the input velocity information. In areas with strong \\nanisotropy due to varying elastic wave velocities according to the ' metadata={'source': '/home/user/다운로드/test2.pdf', 'page': 12}\n",
      "[/INST]  Hey there! I'm here to help you with your question. It looks like you're asking about Reverse-Time Migration (RTM) and how it works.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, RTM is a seismic imaging technique that uses numerical analysis to model the wave equation in both forward and backward directions. This allows for the creation of high-resolution images of the subsurface, even in the presence of complex geological structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the key advantages of RTM is its ability to account for all reflection paths, which makes it particularly useful for understanding complex geology. Additionally, RTM can be used for time-lapse elastic wave monitoring, which is important for monitoring changes in the subsurface over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, RTM can be computationally intensive, and the quality of the results is heavily influenced by the input velocity information. This means that accurate velocity information is crucial for obtaining high-quality images.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are ongoing research and development efforts aimed at improving the performance of RTM, such as the use of high-performance computing technology and various techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the technique.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, RTM is a powerful tool for subsurface imaging and monitoring, and ongoing research is aimed at improving its performance and applicability in a variety of fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope that helps! Do you have any other questions about RTM or seismic imaging?\n"
